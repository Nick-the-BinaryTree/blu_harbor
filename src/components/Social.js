      Check the Blu Harbor Facebook chat (msg Nick or someone else to join) or the SF Bay Interns Slack (url: intern.community)
      for social activites. Be aware of age requirements.<br/><br/>

      From barbecues on the water to carpools to San Francisco, there's lots of things to do!
      Seriously, we're all very lonely in our vast rooms and keep coming up with events.<br/><br/>

      To reach SF, you can split an Uber/Lyft for a ride around one hr,
      or spend a bit more time getting a ride to the Caltrain stop to take the train (longer but ~$10 cheaper).<br/><br/>

      There's also free live concerts in Downtown Redwood on Fridays 6pm-8pm (Music on the Square).<br/><br/>

      Message Nick with new finds or to correct information here b/c I haven't been to SF yet lol.<br/><br/>
