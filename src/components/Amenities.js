      Everyone wants to know about bikes. Let's talk about bikes.<br/><br/>

      1. There are bikes parked in stations around the Menlo Park campus that you can pick up without any paperwork. Just drop them off at another station.<br/>
      2. You can get a personal bike from Facebook that you can bring home, but you have to take a training class.<br/>
      3. Blu Harbor will let you borrow a bike after signing up at the leasing office for free.<br/><br/>

      There is a gym on the second floor of the Leasing Office with absolutely majestic restrooms.<br/><br/>

      Make sure you find your way to the Sports Lounge and Outdoor Kitchen area (maybe with a map). It's a hub for intern meetups.<br/><br/>

      Nearby, there's hammocks and a putting green. TBD whether or not Blu Harbor will provide clubs.
      If so, we need to make a mini-golf course.<br/><br/>

      Bair Island is across a small bridge on the entrance road. It's great for both long and short runs.<br/><br/>

      Lastly, you probably saw the pool behind the Leasing Office, but did you see the the hot tub in the corner?<br/><br/>

      If there are any problems with your room, start by calling Oakwood/Synergy. If they can't help you, visit the Leasing Office.
      Synergy's hotline is 24/7. Not sure about Oakwood.<br/><br/>
