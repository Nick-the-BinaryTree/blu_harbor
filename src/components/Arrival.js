      You don't have to check in.<br/><br/>

      There's a lock box tied to your door handle with your keys and everything. Oakwood/Synergy will email you the code to open it.<br/><br/>

      Fun fact: Some interns got a housing company called Synergy, and others got Oakwood. The difference is a free wireless speaker.<br/><br/>

      Everyone seems to get an assortment of slightly different furniture with the same theme.
      Doubles/triples are larger (but not that much larger) than singles and have an extra bathroom.<br/><br/>

      The front office on Blu Harbor Boulevard will often be referred to as the "Leasing Office." I suggest picking up a map of Blu Harbor there.<br/><br/>
