      Your housing company will start you off with two single-meal packs of cereal, mac-n-cheese, and milk. Also some coffee, tea, and other snacks.<br/><br/>
      The ultimate intern strategy is to use the two packs of milk/cereal in your first weekend before the milk goes bad.<br/><br/>

      On the subject of groceries, keep in mind that while you have a fully-equipped kitchen, you really only need to eat on weekends.
      FB provides three meals a day during the week. If you don't want to keep buying milk for cereal, try making oatmeal with water.<br/><br/>

      Intern reports on supermarkets:<br/>
      -Mi Rancho: Closes at 9pm $<br/>
      -Safeway: 24 hrs $$<br/>
      -Trader Joe's: Closes at 9pm $$<br/>
      -Wholefoods: Closes at 10pm $$$<br/>
      (Feel free to message Nick Hartunian w/ more info)<br/><br/>

      You pretty much need an Uber/Lyft/friendly person with a car b/c carrying bags over a mile on unfriendly paths would be awful.<br/><br/>

      It can be tricky to cross the highway, and I'm not going to try to give you directions for liability issues,
      but In-N-Out Burger, iHop, and McDonald's are all within a 20 min walk. Moving in groups is recommended at night.<br/><br/>

      As per ordering food to your room, DoorDash seems to beat GrubHub from a pricing standpoint.
      Despite, the free delivery cost promotion for all restaurants going away after one order, they still win.<br/><br/>

      Habit Burger always delivers for free through DoorDash, and they have chicken clubs, chicken salads, and burgers all under $10.<br/><br/>

      The first time I tried DoorDash, the employee was 30 mins late, but I got a full refund reporting it online.
